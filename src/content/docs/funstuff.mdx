<Background />

Once upon a time, ElvUI use to have some april fools jokes surprise some of it's users. Since times has past, old jokes were removed and were no longer available to the users.

There has been people that want to run around with the Hello Kitty look or wanted to do "The Harlem Shake" with their toon and ui. There has also been requests to even make their ui have a similar appearance of Tukui.

So digging at past code and a lot of back and forth comparing old Tukui look and trying to mimic it in ElvUI, this plugin was created to make it pretty painless to use those missing goodies. This is pretty lightweight and doesn't contain any options that really effect performance all that much, minus the dancing kittens which is very minimal (only because the animation code to loop them to make them dance).
