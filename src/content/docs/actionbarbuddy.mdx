<Background />

Did you ever use ElvUI's Inherit Global Fade option to find it is so close to what you want and wish that you could modify what triggers the bars and which bars?

You can do that! With ActionBar Buddy's Inherit Global Fade option (not ElvUI's built in one), you can pick and choose if the bars share the same triggers, or some have custom triggers set, while the others share the global setting!

ActionBar Buddy is the solution! This ElvUI plugin allows you to focus on what matters by letting you take more control over what ElvUI's Inherit Global Fade gave you so you can set bars to react on a select few events instead of all of the ones ElvUI does. Take that control of your bars now and download ActionBar Buddy!

:::tip[Did you know?]
Did you know that this addon requires ElvUI to use? You can download ElvUI from it's website at [tukui.org](https://tukui.org/elvui) or use a client that supports ElvUI like, [WoWUp](https://wowup.io/), [Wago Addons App](https://addons.wago.io/app), or [CurseBreaker](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker).
