<Background />

This plugin adds a visual indicator to show your current status such as resting, in combat, or just running around as ghost or just plain dead! Currently there is only support for the Player and Target UnitFrames, but will most likely enable it for other frames like focus, targettarget, etc.

The addon will feature a variety of icons to pick from starting with Pepe. The pepe icons includes a bunch of costumes, including the Trans-Dimensional Bird Whistle (Toy). There are some icons based on classes that are equipped with their first available tier sets, and many more!
