<Background />

When you set a keybind for a button, do you wish you could change the text for the bind, 'SHIFT-6' to show as 'Sh-6' instead?
What about when you setup two different keybinds for a button and the text of the one bind will end up showing but you would rather it show the text of other keybind you had set instead? Have you ever wondered why the keybind text gets truncated when there is still plenty of room on the button for the text?

Well now you are able to address these within this ElvUI Plugin!

:::tip[Did you know?]
